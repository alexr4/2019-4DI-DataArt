/**
JSON format explanation

What's a JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, it's a data format designed to represents 
structured informations (like XML of YAML). It's used in a large range of projects
from the web to stand alone application.

A JSON document can have multiple JSONObject and JSONArray array.

What's a JSONObject
A JSONObject is an unordered collection of name/value paris, for exemple :

"name" : "Alex"

Here the JSONObject has a key "name" and a value "Alex". The key is the name of the variable.
A JSONObject can store different data type such as String, number (float, integer, double, long),
boolean, JSONObject and Array.

The JSON is based on object paradigm, which mean a JSONObject can store different JSONObject 
in order to described a simple object. When a JSONObject stroe more than one value, its wrapped
in brackets. For example : 

"person" :{
    "name"   : "Alex",
    "age"    : 32,
    "height" : 1.8
}

What's a JSONArray
A JSONArray is a ordered sequence of values from the same datatype. These values can be String, number (float, integer, double, long),
boolean, JSONObject and Array. The values stored in an JSONArray are wrapped between square brackets.
For Examples

"persons" : [
    {   
        "name"   : "John",
        "age"    : 25,
        "height" : 1.7
    },
    {
        "name"   : "Mick",
        "age"    : 26,
        "height" : 1.8
    },
    {
        "name"   : "Helen",
        "age"    : 24,
        "height" : 1.65
    }
]

Our data set
Our dataset is structured as a JSONArray of JSONObject where each JSONObject described a tree
Each tree is described with 5 JSONObjects :

→ "datasetid" : the id of our dataset
→ "recordid" : the unique id of the tree
→ "fields" : JSONObject describing the tree
→ "geometry" : JSONObject the geometry of the tree (geographic cooridnates)
→ "record_timestamp" : date of the record

The field JSONObject has differents values :
→ "geom_x_y": [
        48.8320775848,
        2.41181713566
            ],
→ "libellefrancais": "If",
→ "objectid": 24896,
→ "idemplacement": "12-08",
→ "arrondissement": "BOIS DE VINCENNES",
→ "circonferenceencm": 101,
→ "hauteurenm": 5,
→ "espece": "baccata",
